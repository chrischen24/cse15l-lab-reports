# **Lab Report 1**
## **cd with no arguments**
![Image](cdnoarg.png)
1. The working directory was home
2. I got this output (nothing) because the command cd is supposed to change the directory we are in, so if there is no argument then the directory is not being changed, so nothing happens.
3. The output is not an error.
## **cd with directory**
![Image](cddirectory.png)
1. The working directory was home
2. There wasn't an actual output when I passed in a directory into the argument, but it changed the terminal by changing the directory to lecture1, which is was we wanted and expected from this.
3. The output is not an error.
## **cd with file**
![Image](cdfile.png)
1. The working directory was lecture1
2. I got an output saying that the file I put in as an argument is not a directory, and that makes sense in this situation because cd is used to change the directory we are in and Hello.java is not a directory.
3. The output was an error and its an error because we put in a file as an argument when it only takes in a directory.
