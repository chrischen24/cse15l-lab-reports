# **Lab Report 1**
## **cd with no arguments**
![Image](cdnoarg.png)
1. The working directory was home
2. I got this output (nothing) because the command cd is supposed to change the directory we are in, so if there is no argument then the directory is not being changed, so nothing happens.
3. The output is not an error
